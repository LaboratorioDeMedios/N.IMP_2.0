Description
---------------
N.IMP is an audiovisual real-time content generator made in Open Frameworks. It is a node-based arquitecture which has different types of inputs to feed content to the application, then layers and mixers to process them and generates a new output. It has a syphon node to export the generated content.

For the moment it's only available for mac.
