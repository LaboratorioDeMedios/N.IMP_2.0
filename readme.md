N.IMP
=====

Node-based Image Processor

Building
---------------
To build this project go to /bin/data path and run setup.sh script

N.IMP uses Openframeworks v0.8.3.


Description
---------------
N.IMP is an audiovisual real-time content generator made in Open Frameworks. It is a node-based arquitecture which has different types of inputs to feed content to the application, then layers and mixers to process them and generates a new output. It has a syphon node to export the generated content.

For the moment it's only available for mac.

### Inputs

- Image and video Sequence

Drag and drop an image or video file to the workspace to create an input of this type. It supports HAP codec for videos.

- Camera

Recognizes every webcam connected to the host.

- Particle Generator

Random particle generator. Control lifetime and gravity/repulsion points.

- Syphon

Consume content published in syphon.

- Audio/OSC/MIDI

Control other node's parameters with audio or midi/osc messages.


### Visual Layers

- IKEDA Layer, Glitch1 Layer, Glitch2 Layer, Image Processor

Greyscale effects, Canny's algorithm, several other effects.

- Shaders

Create your own shaders to apply different transformations. It supports GLSL version 120


### Mixers

- Multi-Channel Switch (up to 16 inputs), Mix Simple Blend, Mix Mask

Mix different inputs and apply transformations


### Outputs

- Syphon Output

Export generated content to syphon server.
